1) https://fgi-digitalsolutions.de - a coach booking application with scheduling and call features, and user profiles. I've implemented new features for the next version of the application. At Digital Solutions, I created a project from scratch, and for a long time, I worked alone, then worked in a team with other developers, mostly in different directions.
Technologies: React, Redux, Firebase, MaterialUI, Firestore

2) https://app.infludata.com - an application for finding influencers for advertising. So that I, as a client, can find the most suitable person to promote my product or service on social networks (Instagram, TikTok).
Technologies: React, Node, MongoDB, HTML/CSS

3) https://www.grafomap.com - an app for purchasing posters and posters to hang on the wall depicting a certain place on the map. An online store in simple terms.
Technologies: React, Node, MongoDB

4) I was working on a project with the same clients with whom I created Grafomap, but it didn't make it to the production stage. The application was created as a service that would connect to the main application via an iframe. In this app, you upload any picture, and the app displays it as a picture on the wall, which you can move, rotate, and resize. I worked on the project myself.
Technologies: React, Redux, Node, MySQL, Docker, AWS s3 storage, Canvas

5) https://jalantikus.com - I was contacted by a client to speed up their website, they had an application written in React that allowed downloading games. I used the Webpack bundle analyzer library to analyze the site's speed and checked it through the lighthouse. This is just an experience not of developing a project, but of improving and speeding it up.
Technologies: React, lighthouse, and Webpack bundle analyzer

6) And one more project http://www.bizitome.com - charcoal and filter manufacturing site for the Chinese market.
